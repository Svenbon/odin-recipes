        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
                <li>1 cup whole fat plain Greek yogurt </li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon granulated garlic </li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon Italian seasoning </li>
                <li>1 pinch salt </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Garlic Toppings</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon melted butter </li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
                <li>½ teaspoon dried parsley </li>
                <li>½ teaspoon garlic granules </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine flour, yogurt, garlic granules, Italian seasoning, and salt in a bowl; mix to combine.S</li>
                <li>Dust work surface with more flour. Transfer dough to work surface. Knead dough for 8 to 10 minutes with the palm of your hand. Add more flour (1 teaspoon at a time) as needed to keep dough from being too sticky.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat (such as Silpat®).</li>
                <li>Shape dough into a rounded loaf. Using a bench scraper, cut off 8 wedges of dough. Roll each wedge of dough into a rope shape and tie into knots. Place knots onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until knots are lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, combine melted butter, oil, garlic granules, and parsley for topping in a small glass bowl. Brush mixture over the warm knots.</li>
